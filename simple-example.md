fetch api to replace ajax, using that

Download the wasm file

`fetch('test.wasm').then(res => res.arrayBuffer());`

then store the result as variable ArrayBuffer

WebAssembly.instatiate\(temp0\)



Module vs Instance

instance is running version of that code. It's got exports, which is foo program
